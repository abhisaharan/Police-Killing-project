# Police-Killing-project
•	Due in part to recent high-profile shootings of civilians by police in the US, the media and public have been scrutinizing police killings heavily. If you browse social media and news sites, you may get the sense that there's been a large uptick in civilian shootings by police in the US.
•	Data is explored for hidden facts and figures and a Jupyter notebook is developed.
•	Combined multiple datasets to get a single clean dataset.
•	Worked on several standard python packages like pandas, Numpy, matPlotLib.
